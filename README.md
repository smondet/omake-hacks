# OMake Scripting

Library of OMake scripts to include in your projects.

The idea is to make `OMakeroot` files as declarative as possible for common use
cases, using functions from `OMakeLibrary.om`.

See current development on Ketrew:
<https://github.com/hammerlab/ketrew/tree/joo-gui>
or <https://github.com/smondet/plawireg> for examples of usage.
